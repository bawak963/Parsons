#### Course Description:
Web Design Basics is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium-as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a "learning through making" approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed


#### Class Values:
* Speaking in class happens. 
* Develop skills and help others develop their skills.
* Prototypes are "Theory in Action".
* Simplicity is your friend in this course. 
* Time and attention are today's users' most limited resource.
