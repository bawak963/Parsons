There are no formal prerequisites to this course but it is strongly suggested to have taken a class using object-oriented programming in Processing, Open Frameworks, or other environment or language. A class on game design or Unity will also help. Lectures will consist of programming workshops and lectures on historical and contemporary topics. Assignments will consist of code prototypes turned in via github and a polished midterm and final demonstrating an understanding of the techniques used in the class with a unique voice.

#### Learning Outcomes: 
Students will:
* develop a critical understanding of game frameworks and their relationship to creative output
* develop experiments with classic approaches to rendering, AI, and procedural generation
* gain an introductory look at a number of different game programming frameworks
* build experimental game prototypes focused around systems aesthetics 
#### Assessment Criteria:	
* Class participation/research: 20%
* Prototypes/homework: 50%
* Final project: 30%
#### Participation/Research: 
Students are expected to show up to class on time, turn in assignments, be respectful to one another and put in their best effort in pursuing the class material. More than three unexcused absences is grounds for at least a letter-grade deduction.
#### Prototypes/Homework: 
Prototypes are small responses to challenges to be turned in via github with links posted on the class wiki. They usually will involve either hacking provided code, adapting provided code to a new framework, or a creative/conceptual/aesthetic challenge. Homework will often differ based on the skill level of the student.
#### Final Project: 

The final project is a game project that explores in depth at least one technical area of the course and one conceptual (rendering aesthetics, procedural rhetoric). It should be built in one of the tools used in the class or one approved by me.


#### Class Values:

* Speaking in class happens. 
* Develop skills and help other develop their skills.
* Prototypes are Theory in Action
* Simplicity is your friend 
* Time, and attention, is your most valuable resource. 
* Find the aesthetic possibilities in a myriad of formal constraints
