This class is for learning how to program iPhone or iPad games and experiences.  We build new prototypes every week. Students create and maintain projects on their own laptops or gitHub. This class assumes no prior programming knowledge. Requires a desire to learn.

#### Learning Outcomes: 
Students will:
* TDB
* TDB
* TDB
* TDB 
#### Assessment Criteria:	
* Class participation/research: 35%
* Prototypes/homework: 40%
* Final project: 25%
#### Participation/Research: 
Students are expected to show up to class on time, turn in assignments, be respectful to one another and put in their best effort in pursuing the class material. More than three unexcused absences is grounds for at least a letter-grade deduction.
#### Prototypes/Homework: 
Prototypes are small responses to challenges assigned in-class. They usually will involve either hacking provided code, adapting provided code to a new framework, or a creative/conceptual/aesthetic challenge. Homework will often differ based on the skill level of the student.
#### Final Project: 
The final project is a game project that explores in depth at least one technical area of the course and one conceptual (rendering aesthetics, procedural rhetoric). It should be built in one of the tools used in the class or OK'ed by instructor.


#### Class Values:

* Speaking in class happens. 
* Develop skills and help others develop their skills.
* Prototypes are "Theory in Action".
* Simplicity is your friend in this course. 
* Time and attention, are your most valuable resource.
